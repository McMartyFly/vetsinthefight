              You see, we wanted to gain a better understanding
              of our operational and civic environment, and to begin maturing the VPAC approach to providing veterans a venue beyond just a
              beer and barbecue (although, we’ll do that, too.) In the course of VPAC I, it became clear that what we’d initiated was a veteran
              forum, a kind of think-tank, a problem-solving environment, where we applied our varied experience and the military decision-
              making process (MDMP) to the resolution of those issues. One of our key issues was to give veterans a voice in their Republic, hence
              the adoption of the <span>Vets in the Fight&#174;</span> concept.

            <p class="lead">
              On Day 2 of our VPAC I, we were honored to have visits by Dr. Ben Carson, world-renowned surgeon, and by Mr. Donald Trump,
              accomplished businessman, both candidates running in the 2016 South Carolina
              Presidential Primary Elections the following day. (All candidates were invited to VPAC
              I, but only Dr. Carson and Mr. Trump responded.) Each of them brought his own
              approach to national security, and each contributed to maturing our <span>Vets in the
              Fight®</span> concept. Mr. Trump, especially, was interested in our top veteran issues. He
              gave us a thumbs-up on our VPAC efforts and accepted a Vets in the Fight® challenge
              coin that sits today on display behind his Oval Office desk.
