            <h2>Welcome to the Veterans Patriot Action Conference (VPAC)<br>&amp; Welcome all you Vets in the Fight &#174;</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              The Veterans Patriot Action Conference is one of the younger combat veteran organizations on the block, incorporated in the
              Summer of 2015. We are a non-profit veteran organization under provisions of IRS 501 (c) 19.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We believe that veterans represent a vast, and untapped, reservoir of values, ethos, mission-first outlook and personal honor;
              attributes that ae sadly fading from the American culture. We believe that the military veteran is the final American institutional
              reservoir of these key values shaped and inculcated through the crucible of honorable service.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We believe that veterans must stick together in a world, at least for the moment, that claims to approve of us and of our honorable
              service, a condition that can change rapidly, as those of us who served in Vietnam will vouch.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We believe that the values of Duty, Honor, Country and Competence in the face of adversity are qualities that have become a rarity
              in our society, yet, are ingredients indispensable to the sustainment of a viable republic.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We believe that most veterans carry into civilian life, whether after three years or after thirty years of honorable service, a sense of
              purpose summarized by their open-ended military oaths, which state in part...
            </p>
            <p class="excerpt">
              &quot; I ... do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States
              against all enemies, foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take
              this obligation freely, without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion ... So help me God.&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We know there are millions of honorably discharged veterans who continue to live by their military oaths in their everyday lives.
              These we call ‘Vets in the Fight&#174;’, men and women who’s conduct and actions represent the values espoused in their oaths. Vets in
              the Fight is also a concept aimed at giving substance to those special qualities in continuing service to our Nation. Vets in the Fight
              must: Vote ... they must serve in public office ... they must hold government accountable in adherence to the US Constitution, as
              written. Vets in the Fight® are compelled to continue the ‘mission’ to defend that Constitution.

            <h2>VPAC and Vets in the Fight is born... in Charleston, South Carolina, February 2016.</h2>
            <p class="lead top-p">
              The Veterans Patriot Action Conference (VPAC for short) held its first conference on 18 -19 February 2016, in Charleston, SC. Over
              100 special operations and other service veterans and wives from across the country assembled for VPAC I, where we were given a
              world level perspective on national security by distinguished professionals, like Admiral James ‘Ace’ Lyons, former US Commander in
              Chief, Pacific (USCINCPAC); by Lieutenant General Tom McInerney, former US Air Force combat wing commander (he bombed
              Khadafi in 1986), Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, and FoxNews contributor; Lieutenant Colonel Jay Delancy, USAF
              retired, CEO of the VoterIntegrityProject.com and other subject matter experts. You see, we wanted to gain a better understanding
              of our operational and civic environment, and to begin maturing the VPAC approach to providing veterans a venue beyond just a
              beer and barbecue (although, we’ll do that, too.) In the course of VPAC I, it became clear that what we’d initiated was a veteran
              forum, a kind of think-tank, a problem-solving environment, where we applied our varied experience and the military decision-
              making process (MDMP) to the resolution of those issues. One of our key issues was to give veterans a voice in their Republic, hence
              the adoption of the Vets in the Fight&#174; concept.
            </p>
            <h2>VPAC is recognized...by a future President</h2>
            <img class="bottom-img" src="img/VPAC-with-future-president.jpg" alt="VPAC Members with Donald Trump" />
            <p class="lead">
              On Day 2 of our VPAC I, we were honored to have visits by Dr. Ben Carson, world renowned surgeon, and by Mr. Donald Trump,
              accomplished businessman, both candidates running in the 2016 South Carolina
              Presidential Primary Elections the following day. (All candidates were invited to VPAC
              I, but only Dr. Carson and Mr. Trump responded.) Each of them brought his own
              approach to national security, and each contributed to maturing our Vets in the
              Fight® concept. Mr. Trump, especially, was interested in our top veteran issues. He
              gave us a thumbs-up on our VPAC efforts and accepted a Vets in the Fight® challenge
              coin that sits today on display behind his Oval Office desk.
